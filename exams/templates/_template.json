    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "single",
      "question": "Example single-answer question: What is the primary purpose of a project charter?",
      "options": [
        "To document the project budget",
        "To formally authorize the project and provide the project manager with authority",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      "maxSelections": 4,
      "explanation": "Iterative development provides faster feedback from stakeholders and enables the team to adapt to changing requirements. However, it does not reduce the need for testing (testing is still crucial in each iteration), and it doesn't guarantee lower costs in all cases.",

      "type": "single",
      "question": "What is the difference between a risk and an issue?",

        "There is no difference, they are the same thing",
